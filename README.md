## Goal

To create a web app using Google Maps API, Yelp API and REACT that is responsive, accessible, and available offline.

## Access

To access this web app:

	1. Clone/Download the repository to your local drive.
	2. From the command line at project root, run `npm install` and `npm start`
	3. If the browser does not automatically open the app, then with your server running,
	 navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This project wouldn't have been possible without the fantastic help of Doug Brown. His [walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVAVLCJwAAo&feature=youtu.be) as well as his guidance in our Slack forum was priceless. Thank you so much!
